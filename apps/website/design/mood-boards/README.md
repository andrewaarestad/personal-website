# Mood Board Iterations

This directory contains design iteration documentation and screenshots.

## Structure

Each iteration gets its own directory:

```
mood-boards/
├── v1-minimal/
│   ├── README.md       # Iteration notes and decisions
│   └── screenshots/    # Playwright-generated screenshots
├── v2-bold/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── screenshots/
└── v3-final/
    ├── README.md
    └── screenshots/
```

## Creating a New Iteration

1. **Create directory**: `mkdir [iteration-name]`
2. **Create README.md** with:
   - Design goals for this iteration
   - Key decisions made
   - Feedback received
   - Changes for next iteration

3. **Create mood board page**: `src/app/design-preview/[iteration-name]/page.tsx`
4. **Generate screenshots**: Run Playwright tests
5. **Deploy to Vercel**: Commit and push for live preview
6. **Review and iterate**: Gather feedback, create next iteration

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that indicate the design direction:
- `v1-minimal` - First iteration, minimal design
- `v2-bold` - Second iteration, bold colors and typography
- `v3-professional` - Third iteration, professional feel
- `final-approved` - Approved final design

## Mood Board Pages

Live preview pages are created in:
```
src/app/design-preview/[iteration-name]/page.tsx
```

These pages showcase:
- Color palette swatches
- Typography examples (all heading levels, body text)
- Component variations (buttons, cards, forms)
- Layout examples (hero sections, content layouts)

## Screenshots

Screenshots are automatically generated by Playwright tests in:
```
design-tests/mood-boards/capture.spec.ts
```

Screenshots are saved to:
```
[iteration-name]/screenshots/
├── full-page-Desktop_Chrome.png
├── full-page-Mobile_Safari.png
├── colors-Desktop_Chrome.png
└── ... more screenshots
```

## Workflow

1. Create mood board page
2. Run Playwright to capture screenshots
3. Review screenshots (AI agent shows them to user)
4. Deploy to Vercel for live review
5. Gather feedback
6. Document feedback in README
7. Create next iteration or approve

## Status Tracking

Mark the status in each iteration's README:
- 🔨 **In Progress** - Currently being designed
- 👀 **In Review** - Awaiting feedback
- 🔄 **Superseded** - Replaced by newer iteration
- ✅ **Approved** - Final approved design
