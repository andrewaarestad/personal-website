# Brand Guidelines

## Mission Statement

This personal website exists to showcase thought leadership in AI/ML engineering, demonstrate real-world projects that bridge research and product, and share the personal interests and curiosities of someone who has been shipping machine learning systems for over 15 years.

The site serves as a digital portfolio and a window into both the technical depth and the big-picture thinking that defines my approach to building intelligent systems.

## Core Values

- **Pragmatic Innovation** - Real systems that ship, not just research papers
- **Technical Depth with Perspective** - Getting into the nitty-gritty while never losing sight of the big picture
- **Genuine Curiosity** - Earnest exploration of ideas, technologies, and interests
- **Constructive Realism** - Honest about pitfalls without cynicism or negativity

## Brand Personality

**Adjectives:** Technical, Whimsical, Genuine, Pragmatic, Experienced, Earnest

**Tone:** Dry but not cynical. Accessible but deeply knowledgeable. Playful without being frivolous.

**Feel:** Like walking into an artist's studio - light-filled space with creative work in progress, pops of color drawing attention to interesting details, a sense of both craft and experimentation.

## Competitive Positioning

**What makes this different:**

- **15+ years of shipping ML** - Built production ML systems long before the current AI hype cycle
- **Full-stack depth** - From firmware and signal processing to cloud ML pipelines to user-facing applications
- **Research → Product bridge** - Lives at the boundary between advanced algorithms and shipping real products
- **Avoids the engineer trap** - Technical depth presented with big-picture context and business impact

**Not trying to be:**

- A consulting/agency website (no client acquisition focus)
- Academic/research-heavy (though technically rigorous)
- Generic tech portfolio (emphasizes unique positioning and personal voice)

## Key Messages

**What visitors should take away:**

1. **Depth of Experience** - This person has been solving real ML problems for 15+ years across diverse domains
2. **Pragmatic Expertise** - Combines research-level understanding with product shipping experience
3. **Broad Technical Range** - Comfortable from firmware to cloud, from signal processing to generative AI
4. **Authentic Voice** - Genuine, earnest, thoughtful perspective on technology and building systems
5. **Interesting Person** - Beyond the resume, there are interests, hobbies, and a unique perspective worth following

## Visual Direction

**Metaphor:** Art studio workspace

- **Foundation:** Light, airy, clean - a well-lit studio space
- **Structure:** Black accents provide definition and clarity
- **Interest:** Pops of color highlight important elements, like finished pieces in a gallery
- **Feel:** Whimsical but professional, playful but purposeful

**Mobile-First:** The primary experience should be optimized for mobile viewing, as this reflects how most people will discover and explore the site.

**Light Mode Primary:** The default experience is light and bright, though dark mode support could be considered for accessibility.

## Content Strategy

**Primary Content Types:**

1. **Project Showcases** - Deep dives into specific projects (one-off pages, not CMS-generated)
2. **Thought Leadership** - Insights on AI/ML, product development, bridging research and practice
3. **Portfolio Elements** - Links to GitHub, open-source work, and other external contributions
4. **Personal Interests** - Hobbies and curiosities that provide context beyond the resume

**Content Principles:**

- Start with the big picture, provide technical depth for those who want it
- Be honest about challenges and trade-offs without being negative
- Show personality and genuine interests alongside technical expertise
- Use whimsy and creativity in presentation while maintaining credibility
