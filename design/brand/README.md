# Brand Guidelines

This directory contains brand and strategy documentation.

## Files to Create

### guidelines.md
Defines the brand foundation:
- Mission statement
- Core values
- Brand personality
- Competitive positioning
- Key messages

### persona.md
Defines target audience:
- Demographics
- Professional background
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points
- User journey

### voice-tone.md

- Tone spectrum for different contexts

- Example copy

## Template Location

See `docs/design-workflow.md` for detailed templates and instructions.

## Next Steps

1. Create `guidelines.md` first - this informs all other decisions
2. Then create `persona.md` - understand who you're designing for
3. Finally `voice-tone.md` - how to communicate with them

---

**All subsequent design decisions should reference and align with these brand documents.**
